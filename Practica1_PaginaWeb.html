	   <font size=3 color="white" face="verdana">The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots (also called pellets). When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next  
	    stage.Between some stages one of three intermission animations plays.[22] Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man.
	    If an enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost and the Pac-Man itself withers and dies. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Pac-Man is awarded a 
	    single bonus life at 10,000 points by defaultÂ—DIP switches inside the machine can change the required points or disable the bonus life altogether.

	    <font size=3 color="white" face="verdana"> Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man 
	    with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, 
	    its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to 
	    become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter  
	    as the game progresses.In later stages, the enemies go straight to flashing, bypassing blue, which means that they can only be eaten for a short amount 
	    of time, although they still reverse direction when a power pellet is eaten; in even later stages, the ghosts do not become edible (i.e., they do 
	    not change color and still make Pac-Man lose a life on contact), but they still reverse direction.

	    <font size=3 color="white" face="verdana">The enemies in Pac-Man are known as "ghosts" or "monsters".[23][24] Despite the seemingly random nature of the
	    enemies, their movements are strictly deterministic, which players have used to their advantage. In an interview, creator Toru Iwatani stated that he had designed each enemy with its own 
	    distinct personality in order to keep the game from becoming impossibly difficult or boring to play.[25] More recently, Iwatani described the enemy 
	    behaviors in more detail at the 2011 Game Developers Conference. He stated that the red enemy chases Pac-Man, and the pink and blue enemies try 
	    to position themselves in front of Pac-Man's mouth.[26] Although he claimed that the orange enemy's behavior is random, a careful analysis of the game's
	    code reveals that it actually chases Pac-Man most of the time, but also moves toward the lower-left corner of the maze when it gets too close
	    to Pac-Man.
